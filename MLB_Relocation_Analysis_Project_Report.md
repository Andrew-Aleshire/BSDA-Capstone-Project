## C. Design of Data Analytics Solution

### 1. Project Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis:** MLB franchise relocations result in statistically significant improvements in team performance, as measured by win-loss percentage, with an average improvement of at least 0.030 (3 percentage points) in the five years following relocation.

**Secondary Hypotheses:**
- Relocations to larger markets show greater performance improvements than relocations to smaller markets
- More recent relocations (post-1970) show different performance patterns than earlier relocations
- Performance improvements are sustained over time rather than representing temporary effects

### 2. Analytical Methods

**Primary Analytical Method: Predictive Analytics**

The analysis employs predictive analytics as the primary method, using historical performance data to forecast the likely outcomes of franchise relocations. This approach combines:

- **Descriptive Analytics:** Summarizing historical win-loss patterns and relocation characteristics
- **Diagnostic Analytics:** Identifying factors that contributed to successful or unsuccessful relocations
- **Predictive Analytics:** Developing models to forecast performance changes for future relocations
- **Prescriptive Analytics:** Providing recommendations for optimal relocation strategies

### 2a. Justification for Analytical Methods

**Predictive Analytics Justification:**
Predictive analytics is most appropriate for this project because stakeholders need forward-looking insights to inform future relocation decisions. While descriptive analytics provides valuable historical context, predictive modeling enables organizations to estimate the probability and magnitude of performance changes before committing to relocation investments.

**Statistical Testing Integration:**
The predictive approach incorporates rigorous statistical testing (t-tests, effect size calculations) to ensure that historical patterns are statistically significant and not due to random variation. This combination provides both statistical rigor and practical applicability.

**Time Series Analysis:**
Given the temporal nature of sports performance, time series analysis within the predictive framework captures trends, seasonality, and long-term effects that simple cross-sectional analysis would miss.

**Data Quality Metrics:**
- **Completeness** percentage (target: >95%)
- **Accuracy** validation against external sources
- **Consistency** checks across related variables
- **Timeliness** of data updates and processing

### 4a. Justification for Evaluation Methods

**Statistical Rigor:** P-values and confidence intervals provide objective measures of statistical significance, ensuring that observed effects are not due to random chance. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) complement significance tests by quantifying practical importance.

**Predictive Accuracy:** MAE and RMSE are appropriate for continuous outcome variables (win percentage) and provide interpretable measures of prediction quality. Cross-validation prevents overfitting and ensures models generalize to new data.

**Business Relevance:** These metrics directly relate to stakeholder decision-making needs - statistical significance indicates reliability, while effect sizes and prediction accuracy inform the magnitude of expected impacts.

### 5. Practical Significance Assessment

**Quantitative Criteria:**
- **Minimum Effect Size:** Cohen's d ≥ 0.3 (small to medium effect)
- **Performance Improvement:** Win percentage change ≥ 0.020 (2 percentage points)
- **Consistency:** ≥60% of relocated franchises show positive performance changes
- **Sustainability:** Effects maintained for ≥5 years post-relocation

**Qualitative Criteria:**
- **Historical Context:** Results align with known successful/unsuccessful relocations
- **Expert Validation:** Sports industry professionals confirm practical relevance
- **Stakeholder Utility:** Findings inform actual relocation decisions
