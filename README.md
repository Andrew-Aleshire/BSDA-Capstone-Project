# MLB Relocation Analysis Project

A comprehensive data analytics project examining the impact of franchise relocations on Major League Baseball team performance. This project analyzes historical win-loss data to determine whether relocating franchises experience statistically significant changes in performance.

## Project Overview

**Research Question:** Does franchise relocation significantly impact Major League Baseball team performance, as measured by win-loss percentage?

This project provides evidence-based insights for sports organizations, investors, and municipal authorities making multi-million dollar relocation decisions by analyzing over 150 years of MLB historical data.

## Key Findings

- **8 out of 10** relocated franchises show performance improvements post-relocation
- **Average improvement** of 0.050 (5 percentage points) in win percentage
- **Most successful relocations:** Yankees (+13.3%), Brewers (+9.4%), Orioles (+7.3%)
- **Statistical significance** confirmed through rigorous hypothesis testing
