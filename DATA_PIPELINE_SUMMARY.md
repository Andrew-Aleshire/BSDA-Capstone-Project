# MLB Relocation Analysis Pipeline - Data Refinement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the data pipeline refinements made to ensure accurate analysis of MLB team win/loss percentages before and after franchise relocations.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Master Franchise Mapping System
**Created:** `scripts/corrected_franchise_mapping.py`

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive mapping of all major MLB franchise relocations
- Proper handling of complex cases (multiple relocations, league changes)
- Exclusion of defunct 19th century teams that would skew analysis
- Canonical franchise IDs for consistent analysis

**Relocated Franchises Mapped:**
- Atlanta Braves: Boston (1876-1952) → Milwaukee (1953-1965) → Atlanta (1966-present)
- Los Angeles Dodgers: Brooklyn (1884-1957) → Los Angeles (1958-present)
- San Francisco Giants: New York (1883-1957) → San Francisco (1958-present)
- Oakland Athletics: Philadelphia (1901-1954) → Kansas City (1955-1967) → Oakland (1968-present)
- Minnesota Twins: Washington Senators (1901-1960) → Minnesota (1961-present)
- Texas Rangers: Washington Senators (1961-1971) → Texas (1972-present)
- Baltimore Orioles: St. Louis Browns (1902-1953) → Baltimore (1954-present)
- Milwaukee Brewers: Seattle Pilots (1969) → Milwaukee (1970-present)
- Washington Nationals: Montreal Expos (1969-2004) → Washington (2005-present)
- New York Yankees: Baltimore Orioles (1901-1902) → New York (1903-present)

### 2. Data Validation System
**Created:** `scripts/data_validation.py`, `scripts/validate_and_fix_data.py`

**Validation Checks:**
- Basic data quality (null values, calculation accuracy)
- Historical accuracy (reasonable year ranges, game counts)
- Franchise continuity across relocations
- Cross-validation against known historical facts

**Issues Identified and Resolved:**
- 120 unique franchise IDs reduced to 30 relevant modern franchises
- Proper handling of Lahman database franchise ID conventions
- Identification of 80 defunct 19th century teams excluded from analysis
- Validation of win percentage calculations (100% accurate)

### 3. Analysis-Ready Dataset
**Output:** `team_seasons_analysis_ready.csv`

**Features:**
- 2,836 seasons (92.2% of original data retained)
- 30 mapped franchises (10 relocated, 20 stable/expansion)
- Pre/post relocation annotations
- Years since relocation calculations
- Canonical franchise IDs for consistent analysis

## Statistical Analysis Readiness

### Franchises Ready for Analysis (≥10 seasons pre and post relocation):
1. **Atlanta Braves** (1966): 90 pre + 59 post seasons
2. **Los Angeles Dodgers** (1958): 74 pre + 67 post seasons  
3. **San Francisco Giants** (1958): 75 pre + 67 post seasons
4. **Oakland Athletics** (1968): 67 pre + 57 post seasons
5. **Minnesota Twins** (1961): 60 pre + 64 post seasons
6. **Baltimore Orioles** (1954): 53 pre + 71 post seasons
7. **Texas Rangers** (1972): 11 pre + 53 post seasons
8. **Washington Nationals** (2005): 36 pre + 20 post seasons

### Franchises with Insufficient Data:
- **Milwaukee Brewers** (1970): Only 1 pre-relocation season
- **New York Yankees** (1903): Only 2 pre-relocation seasons

## Win Percentage Changes Observed

| Franchise | Relocation | Pre-Relocation Avg | Post-Relocation Avg | Change |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| NYY | Baltimore → New York (1903) | 0.436 | 0.569 | +0.133 |
| MIL | Seattle → Milwaukee (1970) | 0.395 | 0.489 | +0.094 |
| BAL | St. Louis → Baltimore (1954) | 0.433 | 0.505 | +0.073 |
| TEX | Washington → Texas (1972) | 0.418 | 0.487 | +0.069 |
| OAK | Kansas City → Oakland (1968) | 0.464 | 0.514 | +0.050 |
| LAD | Brooklyn → Los Angeles (1958) | 0.515 | 0.550 | +0.034 |
| MIN | Washington → Minnesota (1961) | 0.465 | 0.497 | +0.033 |
| ATL | Milwaukee → Atlanta (1966) | 0.497 | 0.522 | +0.024 |
| WSN | Montreal → Washington (2005) | 0.486 | 0.480 | -0.006 |
| SFG | New York → San Francisco (1958) | 0.554 | 0.516 | -0.038 |

## Data Quality Metrics

### Before Refinement:
- 3,075 total seasons
- 120 franchise IDs (many defunct/irrelevant)
- Inconsistent franchise mapping
- Missing validation

### After Refinement:
- 2,836 analysis-ready seasons (92.2% retention)
- 30 relevant franchise IDs
- Comprehensive franchise lineage mapping
- Full data validation pipeline
- 8/10 relocated franchises ready for statistical testing

## Pipeline Files Created

1. **`scripts/corrected_franchise_mapping.py`** - Master franchise mapping system
2. **`scripts/data_validation.py`** - Comprehensive validation framework
3. **`scripts/validate_and_fix_data.py`** - Data quality analysis and fixes
4. **`scripts/pipeline_summary.py`** - Pipeline status and recommendations

   - Meta-analysis across all relocations
   - Effect size calculations (Cohen's d)

2. **Control for Confounding Variables:**
   - Era effects (deadball era, expansion era, etc.)
   - League differences (AL vs NL)
   - Stadium effects (new ballparks)

3. **Advanced Analysis:**
   - Time-series analysis for temporal trends
   - Regression analysis with multiple factors
   - Survival analysis for sustained effects

4. **Validation:**
   - Cross-reference with historical context
   - Sensitivity analysis
   - Robustness checks

## Conclusion

The data pipeline has been significantly refined and is now ready for robust statistical analysis of MLB franchise relocation effects. The corrected franchise mapping ensures accurate lineage tracking, comprehensive validation confirms data quality, and the analysis-ready dataset provides clean, well-annotated data for testing statistical significance of relocation impacts on team performance.
